Smart home control device
Bluetooth adapter and Bluetooth device:
The Bluetooth adapter is an additional adapter for working with Bluetooth
devices, optimizing the device interface.
Bluetooth device - A class that installs a Bluetooth device.
The connect(), disconnect(), sendData(string data), and receiveData() methods
use basic Bluetooth operations.
Device Factory:
The built-in DeviceFactory is a CreateDevice() method, which is intended for
use with factory classes to create devices.
HomeControlContext and HomeModeStrategy for home use:
HomeControlContext manages the smart user management strategy.
HomeModeStrategy is a specific strategy that optimizes the home
management strategy.
HomeController:
The built-in home controller controls the boot and remote system.
The method management system (SmartDevice SmartDevice) does not require
automation.
Observer and Subject:
An independent observer and a subject represent the "Observer" pattern.
The SmartHomeProvider provider analyzes information about the subject and
provides methods for adding, removing and removing browsers.
SmartHomeUser is a specific user.
Smart devices and decorators:
Smart Device is a tool for managing smart devices.
Decorators (ColorChangingDecorator, SpeedControlDecorator,
TemperatureControlDecorator) add value to universally smart devices.
DeviceAdapter and DeviceFactory:
DeviceAdapter is a tool for configuring devices.
DeviceFactory is a tool for creating devices.
LampFactory and SmartFan/Smart Lamp:
Lamp Factory is a laboratory for creating smart lamps.
SmartFan and SmartLamp are specific solutions for smart users.
Smart devices:
New classes of smart devices have been introduced - SmartSocket and Smart
Thermostat. Each of them implements the Smart Device interface with the
TurnOn and turnOff methods.
Factories for creating devices:
SocketFactory and ThermostatFactory implement the Device Factory interface
for creating smart sockets and thermostats, respectively.
Management strategies:
Added new management strategies - EnergySavingModeStrategy and
GuestModeStrategy. Each of them implements the Home Control Strategy
interface and provides various ways to control smart devices.
Zigbee and Z-Wave adapters:
Adapters have been introduced for devices operating under the Zigbee and ZWave protocols - ZigbeeAdapter and ZWaveAdapter. Each of them implements
the DeviceAdapter interface for connecting, disconnecting, sending and
receiving data via the corresponding protocol.
